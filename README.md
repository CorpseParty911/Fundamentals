# Steering_Starter
Rudimentary demonstration of a selection of fundamental steering behaviors in Unity.<br/>
Each object operating according to a steering behavior consists of a cube with a sphere attached to the front to indicate direction.<br/>
The following behaviors are represented, with the brown cube serving as the target where applicable:<br/>
* red: seek<br/>
* blue: arrive and align<br/>
* black: wander<br/>
* purple: face<br/>
* white: separate (This cube does not have a sphere indicating its front)<br/>
